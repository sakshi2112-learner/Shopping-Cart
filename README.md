# Shopping-Cart

I have created a basic web page that allows users to add items to a shopping cart using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The page contains a form where the user can enter the name and price of the item they want to add to the cart. When the user clicks the "Add Item" button, the item is added to the cart and the total price of all items in the cart is displayed. The page also displays the list of items in the cart and their individual prices. The CSS is used to style the page and make it visually appealing.
